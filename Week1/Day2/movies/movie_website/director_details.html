        Wesley Wales Anderson (born May 1, 1969) is an American filmmaker.
        His films are known for their eccentricity, unique visual and narrative styles, and frequent use of ensemble casts.
        They often contain themes of grief, loss of innocence, and dysfunctional families. Some critics cite Anderson as an auteur.
        Three of his films[a] have appeared in BBC Culture's 2016 poll of the greatest films since 2000.</p>
